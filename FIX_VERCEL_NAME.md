# Fix Vercel "Name Already Used" Error

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Use a Different Repository Name (Easiest)

1. In the Vercel form, change "Public Repository Name" to something like:
   - `smart-planner-app`
   - `smart-planner-web`
   - `my-smart-planner`
   - `smartplanner-frontend`

2. Click "Create"

3. Vercel will create a NEW repository on GitHub with that name

### Option 2: Import Existing Repository (Recommended)

Instead of creating a new repository, import your existing one:

1. **Go back** to Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/vrasishs-projects

2. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**

3. Look for **"Import Git Repository"** button (not "Create Git Repository")

4. Search for or select: `vrasish/smart-planner`

5. Click **"Import"**

This will use your existing GitHub repository instead of creating a new one.

### Option 3: Check if Project Already Exists

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/vrasishs-projects

2. Look in your projects list - you might already have a "smart-planner" project

3. If it exists, you can:
   - Use that existing project
   - Or delete it and create a new one
   - Or rename it

## Recommended: Use Option 2 (Import Existing)

This is the best option because:
- ✅ Uses your existing GitHub repository
- ✅ No need to create a new repo
- ✅ All your code is already there
- ✅ No name conflicts
